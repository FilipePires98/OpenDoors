## Description

The OpenDoors initiative emerged as a response to the demand for systems that relieve the workload in physical store environments in order to bring greater comfort to both workers and users.
Thus, it is available to the user features that range from controlling room temperature to monitoring the comfort of the store's customers and the health of employees.

OpenDoors is:
- a highly scalable system
- of easy integration of new modules and different sensors
- practical and intuitive
- fast and simple to deploy

## Repository Structure:

/application - source code of the android mobile application

/docs - project documentation (presentation, diagrams, ...)

/sensors - python scripts to interact with the supported sensors

/server - source code of the backend (data processing and persistance)
